Sitecore Content Tracker
========================

This module allows you to assign goals, page events and profiling to one item 
and have another item use the settings assigned to the first item.

For example, you can apply profiling to an item that represents a product 
category and have Sitecore use the profiling for all items that reference 
the product category item.
